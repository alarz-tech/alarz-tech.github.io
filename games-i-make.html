    <p><i>The list of games will be here once they are publicly available and I write something meaningful about them. In the meanwhile...</i></p>

    <h2>Principles</h2>

    <p>These are some priniciples I've came to during the years of playing and making games. They are reflections of my personal taste and not an absolute truth whatsoever, and you might disagree with them, but they are what guides <strong>me</strong> in my game-related activities.</p>

    <h3>Games should be games</h3>
    <p>Games should be fun to play. That means game mechanics are more important than anything else. In particular, story and graphics are less important. They <em>are</em> important, just <em>less.</em></p>
    <p>Games are games. That's not the same as interactive novels or movies or <a href="https://www.tale-of-tales.com/tales/RAM.html">realtime art</a> or anything else. Those are great, and we all might enjoy them, it's just not what I want to make.</p>

    <h3>Games should be unique</h3>
    <p>Despite the fact that making games isn't easy, there are <strong>a lot</strong> of them out there. No one should waste their time to play (or make) something that's already been done before.</p>
    <p>Being inspired and exploring ideas of others is great. Making something better and more accessible is great. But added value should always outweigh the complexity of creating the game or the effort required to enjoy it.</p>

    <h3>Games should be made to be fun</h3>
    <p>Games shouldn't waste your time. They should provide experiences that worth it. Too many games are designed with the priority of being profitable to their developers. And there <em>are</em> times when goals
      of <i>making the game better</i> vs <i>making the game more profitable</i> (at least in the short term) are at odds. That happens more often than many professional developers are willing to admit.
