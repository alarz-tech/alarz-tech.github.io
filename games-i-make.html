      <h2>Principles</h2>

      <p>
        These are some <i>principles</i> which guide my own independent game-related activities.
        <span class="sidenote">
          Or rather ideals, since honestly I'm not <i>that</i> strict about always following them.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        They are not an absolute truth whatsoever. It's fine to disagree with them.
        They are merely reflections of my personal preferences shaped by years of playing, studying and making games.
      </p>


      <h3 id="games">Games should be games</h3>
      <p>That means game mechanics are more important than anything else. They are the core that provides players with
        interesting experiences by having them constantly make meaningful choices.</p>
      <p>In particular, story and graphics are less important. They <em>are</em> important, just <em>less.</em></p>
      <p>Games aren't just interactive stories or movies or <a class="link-external" href="https://www.tale-of-tales.com/tales/RAM.html"
          target="_blank">realtime art</a> or anything else. Those are great and enjoyable in their own way, it's just
        not what I want to focus on.</p>

      <h3 id="fun">Games should be fun to play</h3>
      <p>They shouldn't waste your time and be <a class="link-external"
          href="https://fischerdesign.medium.com/when-games-idolize-busywork-8454bfe769ff" target="_blank">busywork.</a>
        They should
        provide experiences which are worth it.</p>
      <p>Too many games are designed with
        the priority of being profitable to their developers. There are obvious reasons why games should be profitable
        to their authors, yet there <em>are</em> times when goals
        of <i>making the game better</i> vs <i>making the game more profitable</i> are at
        odds. That happens more often than some people are willing to admit.
      </p>

      <h3 id="novel">Games should have novelty</h3>
      <p>Despite the fact that making games isn't easy, there are <strong>a lot</strong> of them. Why waste your time
        playing and even more so making something that's already been done before?</p>
      <p>Being inspired by other works and building on ideas of others is great. But added value should always outweigh
        the complexity of creating the game or the effort required to enjoy it.</p>
